# Welcome to my CyberVets ePortfolio.

Hello! My name is Ayo Ogunsola and I am currently a CMS Cybervets intern. This is a journey through developing my skill in the Cyber Security field though data and network monitoring.
I graduated from Bowie State University in Maryland with a bachelors degree in communications and then enlisted in the U.S Navy as an Adminstrative assistant in the Navy and after 7 years I decided I would like to learn new skills to help me transition to the civilian workforce. 
Through the skillbridge program I was able to find the CMS cybervets program which is now training me on the skillsets needed for network security monitoring, threat management, reverse engineering and data management.
